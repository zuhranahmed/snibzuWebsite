            Organizations are currently implementing independent systems for
            their quality management systems (ISO 9001, food safety management
            systems (FSSC 22000), environmental management system (ISO 14001),
            occupational health and safety (ISO 18001). Autonomous systems refer
            to the use of isolated document management structures that result in
            duplication of processes within a site for each of the QMS, EMS,
            OHSAS, and FSMS management standards. While the confusion and
            inefficiencies that result from this decision may not be apparent to
            the uninitiated, this book will show the reader that there is a huge
            loss of value associated with independent management systems within
            an organization. This book expands the understanding of an
            Integrated Management System (IMS) globally. Not only does it save
            money, but more importantly it contributes to the maintenance and
            efficiency of business processes and compliance standards such as
            ISO 9001, AS9100, ISO / TS 16949, ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001, FSSC 22000

          <p class="marketing__content--details">
            Digital marketing and web development need to work side by side.
            Simply digital marketing is marketing that uses electronic devices.
            This includes computers, tablets, smartphones, cell phones, digital
            billboards, game consoles and apps that users can add. As the
            digital age continues to grow rapidly, especially with the use of
            mobile technology, digital marketing is becoming increasingly
            important. SNIBZU Sales & Marketing believes that digital marketing
            needs to be coordinated. This is to ensure the advancement of your
            product / service / organization across multiple digital channels.
            Search engine optimization, keyword research, and link building
            tactics can add value to any business.
            <br />
            Ideally, SNIBZU Sales & Marketing would suggest linking to your
            website. In addition, it is important to target and update content
            through Content Management and Systems (CMS). This will facilitate
            search engine optimization (SEO) and ultimately help your business
            grow.
